# Genders

This project is a game written in Vue that helps learners memorize the genders of French words. In the game, the user is shown a French word and must choose whether the word is masculine (un) or feminine (une). If the user's response is incorrect, the word is added to a learning list for future review. This game is a fun and interactive way to expand your knowledge of French genders and expand your vocabulary.
